# ðŸ§¾ Order Management System â€“ MySQL Project

This project demonstrates a simple **Order Management System** using **MySQL**. It includes SQL scripts to manage customers, products, orders, and payments. The goal is to showcase database operations such as data insertion, manipulation, aggregation, joins, procedures, and triggers in a real-world order processing context.

---

##  Project Structure

- `file1_dml.sql`  
   Contains **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** commands to insert sample data into:
  - Customers
  - Products
  - Orders
  - OrderItems
  - Payments

- `file2_ddl_functions.sql`  
   Includes **DDL operations** and usage of:
  - Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
  - Math functions (ROUND, FLOOR)
  - String functions (CONCAT, LENGTH)
  - Date functions (CURRENT_DATE, DATE_ADD)

- `file3_joins_procedure_trigger.sql`  
   Contains:
  - **JOIN queries** to fetch combined data from multiple tables
  - A **stored procedure** to display customer-wise orders
  - A **trigger** that logs price changes of products

---

##  Technologies Used
- MySQL 8.x
- SQL (DDL, DML, Procedures, Triggers)
- Any MySQL-compatible client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin)

##  How to Run This Project

1. Open any MySQL client.
2. Execute the three SQL files in this order:
   - `file1_dml.sql`
   - `file2_ddl_functions.sql`
   - `file3_joins_procedure_trigger.sql`
3. Explore the data and logic using custom queries or your own enhancements.
